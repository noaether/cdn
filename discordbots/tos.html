          and store this information.

          <strong>Logging and Tracking</strong>: The Bot logs and keeps track of
          various events for safety and automatic moderating purposes. However,
          these events will never be accessed by a human and are only readable
          by the Bot itself.

          consent, except as required by law.

          the Bot, including but not limited to direct, indirect, incidental, or
          consequential damages.
